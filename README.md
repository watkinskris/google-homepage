This project is being created to practice my new HTML and CSS skills.

For this first project, I am chosing the easy path 
from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).  

The goal of this project is to recreate the Google Homepage, though buttons and forms may not go anywhere or do anything.
